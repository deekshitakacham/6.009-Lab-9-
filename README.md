In this lab, we'll explore this idea even further by implementing our own interpreter for a dialect of LISP, one of the earliest high-level programming languages, and one with a strong historical connection to MIT (LISP was invented by John McCarthy at MIT in 1958, and the Scheme dialect of LISP was used in MIT's introductory programming subject from ~1975-20071!).
